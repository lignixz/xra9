[xoL prototype first](http://lignixz.github.io/xra9/)

This xoL prototype one is now obsolete. Prototype second will be based on a redesign of xoL, with some fundamental improvements.

This first prototype is useful for the external observer, as the second will probably not be published for the moment. This prototype is intended to give people a rough idea of what xoL is.

The first prototype is not optimized. It is inefficient in terms of performance. This is not going to be fixed, as development goes toward the second prototype in a full rewrite.

## What is this ? What is xoL ?

xoL is a programming language that is not text based. Instead it is based on graphical elements. See the [xoL page](http://lignixz.github.io/xoL/) for more details. This prototype consist of a functional (to somewhat advanced extent) editor for the language and demonstrative code. The code shows some basic concepts of xoL first generation. Assignment, loops, conditionals, function calls, operators are shown. Some concepts supported by the prototype, but not shown in the demo code are types, object properties, etc. The prototype has functionality to create and edit the code.

Further explication will not be given, as the focus is on the improved xoL next version. This prototype will not be updated anymore.
